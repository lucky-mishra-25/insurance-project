# 🏥 Insurance Cost Analysis & Prediction

This project analyzes the Insurance dataset (`insurance.csv`) and builds a machine learning model to predict medical insurance charges based on customer information such as age, BMI, number of children, smoking habits, and region.

The project includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and predictive modeling.
