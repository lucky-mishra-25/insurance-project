🏥 Insurance Cost Analysis & Prediction

This project focuses on analyzing the Insurance Dataset (insurance.csv) and building a machine learning model to predict medical insurance charges based on user attributes such as age, BMI, number of children, smoking status, and region.

The project covers data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and predictive modeling.
